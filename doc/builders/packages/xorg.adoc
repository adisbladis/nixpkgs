= X.org


The Nix expressions for the X.org packages reside in [path]``pkgs/servers/x11/xorg/default.nix``
.
This file is automatically generated from lists of tarballs in an X.org release.
As such it should not be modified directly; rather, you should modify the lists, the generator script or the file [path]``pkgs/servers/x11/xorg/overrides.nix``
, in which you can override or add to the derivations produced by the generator. 

The generator is invoked as follows: 
----

$ cd pkgs/servers/x11/xorg
$ cat tarballs-7.5.list extra.list old.list \
  | perl ./generate-expr-from-tarballs.pl
----

For each of the tarballs in the [path]``.list``
 files, the script downloads it, unpacks it, and searches its [path]``configure.ac``
 and [path]``*.pc.in``
 files for dependencies.
This information is used to generate [path]``default.nix``
.
The generator caches downloaded tarballs between runs.
Pay close attention to the `NOT FOUND: [replaceable]``name``` messages at the end of the run, since they may indicate missing dependencies.
(Some might be optional dependencies, however.) 

A file like [path]``tarballs-7.5.list``
 contains all tarballs in a X.org release.
It can be generated like this: 
----

$ export i="mirror://xorg/X11R7.4/src/everything/"
$ cat $(PRINT_PATH=1 nix-prefetch-url $i | tail -n 1) \
  | perl -e 'while (<>) { if (/(href|HREF)="([^"]*.bz2)"/) { print "$ENV{'i'}$2\n"; }; }' \
  | sort > tarballs-7.4.list
----[path]``extra.list``
 contains libraries that aren`'t part of X.org proper, but are closely related to it, such as ``libxcb``. [path]``old.list``
 contains some packages that were removed from X.org, but are still needed by some people or by other packages (such as [var]``imake``). 

If the expression for a package requires derivation attributes that the generator cannot figure out automatically (say, [var]``patches`` or a [var]``postInstall`` hook), you should modify [path]``pkgs/servers/x11/xorg/overrides.nix``
.
