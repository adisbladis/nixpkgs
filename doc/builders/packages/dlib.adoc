http://dlib.net/[DLib] is a modern, C++-based toolkit which provides several machine learning algorithms. 

== Compiling without AVX support


Especially older CPUs don't support https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions[AVX] (``Advanced Vector Extensions``) instructions that are used by DLib to optimize their algorithms. 

On the affected hardware errors like `Illegal instruction` will occur.
In those cases AVX support needs to be disabled:
