Some packages provide the shell integration to be more useful.
But unlike other systems, nix doesn't have a standard share directory location.
This is why a bunch [command]``PACKAGE-share`` scripts are shipped that print the location of the corresponding shared folder.
Current list of such packages is as following: 

* ``autojump``: [command]``autojump-share``
* ``fzf``: [command]``fzf-share``

E.g. `autojump` can then used in the .bashrc like this: 
----
source "$(autojump-share)/autojump.bash"
----
