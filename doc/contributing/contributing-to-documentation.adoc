The DocBook sources of the Nixpkgs manual are in the [path]``doc``
 subdirectory of the Nixpkgs repository. 

You can quickly check your edits with [command]``make``: 

----

$ cd /path/to/nixpkgs/doc
$ nix-shell
[nix-shell]$ make
----


If you experience problems, run [command]``make debug`` to help understand the docbook errors. 

After making modifications to the manual, it's important to build it before committing.
You can do that as follows: 
----

$ cd /path/to/nixpkgs/doc
$ nix-shell
[nix-shell]$ make clean
[nix-shell]$ nix-build .
----

If the build succeeds, the manual will be in [path]``./result/share/doc/nixpkgs/manual.html``
.
