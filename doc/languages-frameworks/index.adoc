The <<_chap_stdenv,standard build environment>> makes it easy to build typical Autotools-based packages with very little code.
Any other kind of package can be accomodated by overriding the appropriate phases of ``stdenv``.
However, there are specialised functions in Nixpkgs to easily build packages for other programming languages, such as Perl or Haskell.
These are described in this chapter.
