Building a NixOS CD is as easy as configuring your own computer.
The idea is to use another module which will replace your [path]``configuration.nix``
 to configure the system that would be installed on the CD. 

Default CD/DVD configurations are available inside [path]``nixos/modules/installer/cd-dvd``
. 
----

$ git clone https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git
$ cd nixpkgs/nixos
$ nix-build -A config.system.build.isoImage -I nixos-config=modules/installer/cd-dvd/installation-cd-minimal.nix default.nix
----

Before burning your CD/DVD, you can check the content of the image by mounting anywhere like suggested by the following command: 
----

# mount -o loop -t iso9660 ./result/iso/cd.iso /mnt/iso
