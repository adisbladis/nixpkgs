[[_sec_assertions]]
= Warnings and Assertions


When configuration problems are detectable in a module, it is a good idea to write an assertion or warning.
Doing so provides clear feedback to the user and prevents errors after the build. 

Although Nix has the `abort` and `builtins.trace`https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ssec-builtins[functions] to perform such tasks, they are not ideally suited for NixOS modules.
Instead of these functions, you can declare your warnings and assertions using the NixOS module system. 

[[_sec_assertions_warnings]]
== Warnings


This is an example of using ``warnings``.

{ config, lib, ... }:
{
  config = lib.mkIf config.services.foo.enable {
    warnings =
      if config.services.foo.bar
      then [ ''You have enabled the bar feature of the foo service.
               This is known to cause some specific problems in certain situations.
               '' ]
      else [];
  }
}

[[_sec_assertions_assertions]]
== Assertions


This example, extracted from the https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/release-17.09/nixos/modules/services/logging/syslogd.nix[
   syslogd module ] shows how to use ``assertions``.
Since there can only be one active syslog daemon at a time, an assertion is useful to prevent such a broken system from being built.

{ config, lib, ... }:
{
  config = lib.mkIf config.services.syslogd.enable {
    assertions =
      [ { assertion = !config.services.rsyslogd.enable;
          message = "rsyslogd conflicts with syslogd";
        }
      ];
  }
}
