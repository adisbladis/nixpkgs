In some cases, it may be desirable to take advantage of commonly-used, predefined configurations provided by nixpkgs, but different from those that come as default.
This is a role fulfilled by NixOS's Profiles, which come as files living in [path]``<nixpkgs/nixos/modules/profiles>``
.
That is to say, expected usage is to add them to the imports list of your [path]``/etc/configuration.nix``
 as such: 

[source]
----

  imports = [
   <nixpkgs/nixos/modules/profiles/profile-name.nix>
  ];
----


Even if some of these profiles seem only useful in the context of install media, many are actually intended to be used in real installs. 

What follows is a brief explanation on the purpose and use-case for each profile.
Detailing each option configured by each one is out of scope.
