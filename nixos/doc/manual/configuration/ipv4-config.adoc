= IPv4 Configuration


By default, NixOS uses DHCP (specifically, [command]``dhcpcd``) to automatically configure network interfaces.
However, you can configure an interface manually as follows: 
[source]
----

networking.interfaces.eth0.ipv4.addresses = [ {
  address = "192.168.1.2";
  prefixLength = 24;
} ];
----

Typically you`'ll also want to set a default gateway and set of name servers: 
[source]
----

 = "192.168.1.1";
 = [ "8.8.8.8" ];
----

[NOTE]
====
Statically configured interfaces are set up by the systemd service [replaceable]``interface-name````-cfg.service``.
The default gateway and name server configuration is performed by ``network-setup.service``. 
====


The host name is set using <<_opt_networking.hostname>>: 
[source]
----

 = "cartman";
----

The default host name is ``nixos``.
Set it to the empty string (``""``) to allow the DHCP server to provide the host name.
