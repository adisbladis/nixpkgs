The NixOS configuration file [path]``/etc/nixos/configuration.nix``
 is actually a __Nix
  expression__, which is the Nix package manager`'s purely functional language for describing how to build packages and configurations.
This means you have all the expressive power of that language at your disposal, including the ability to abstract over common patterns, which is very useful when managing complex systems.
The syntax and semantics of the Nix language are fully described in the http://nixos.org/nix/manual/#chap-writing-nix-expressions[Nix
  manual], but here we give a short overview of the most important constructs useful in NixOS configuration files.
