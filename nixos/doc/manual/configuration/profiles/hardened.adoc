[[_sec_profile_hardened]]
= Hardened


A profile with most (vanilla) hardening options enabled by default, potentially at the cost of features and performance. 

This includes a hardened kernel, and limiting the system information available to processes through the [path]``/sys``
 and [path]``/proc``
 filesystems.
It also disables the User Namespaces feature of the kernel, which stops Nix from being able to build anything (this particular setting can be overriden via <<_opt_security.allowusernamespaces>>). See the `
  profile source` for further detail on which settings are altered.
