[[_sec_ipv6]]
= IPv6 Configuration


IPv6 is enabled by default.
Stateless address autoconfiguration is used to automatically assign IPv6 addresses to all interfaces.
You can disable IPv6 support globally by setting: 
[source]
----

 = false;
----

You can disable IPv6 on a single interface using a normal sysctl (in this example, we use interface [var]``eth0``): 
[source]
----

."net.ipv6.conf.eth0.disable_ipv6" = true;
----

As with IPv4 networking interfaces are automatically configured via DHCPv6.
You can configure an interface manually: 
[source]
----

networking.interfaces.eth0.ipv6.addresses = [ {
  address = "fe00:aa:bb:cc::2";
  prefixLength = 64;
} ];
----

For configuring a gateway, optionally with explicitly specified interface: 
[source]
----

 = {
  address = "fe00::1";
  interface = "enp0s3";
};
----
