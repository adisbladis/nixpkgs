This section describes how to add additional packages to your system.
NixOS has two distinct styles of package management: 

* __Declarative__, where you declare what packages you want in your [path]``configuration.nix`` . Every time you run [command]``nixos-rebuild``, NixOS will ensure that you get a consistent set of binaries corresponding to your specification. 
* __Ad hoc__, where you install, upgrade and uninstall packages via the [command]``nix-env`` command. This style allows mixing packages from different Nixpkgs versions. It`'s the only choice for non-root users.
